/*!
 *  ======== Watchdog ========
 *  Watchdog Timer module for slave processors
 *
 *  Watchdog module implements watchdog timer for remote slave processor
 *  cores using GPTimers or a dedicated WatchDog timer. The timer is started
 *  during startup/bootup time. The logic for the WD timer is as follows:
 *  1. Start GP timer during startup/boot time.
 *  2. The expiration for WD timer is 5 seconds normally, but is 10 seconds
 *     during initial boot time.
 *  3. The WD timer is restarted in the Idle task through the plugged in DEH
 *     task function, or whenever a Task switch happens or a Swi is executed.
 *  4. In SMP-mode, Hwis and Swis are executed only in Core0 and Tasks can
 *     be executed on either of the cores. Core1 stops it's Watchdog upon
 *     entering Idle task as it can stay in WFI for a long-time (atleast two
 *     tasks need to be in READY state) and restarts its Watchdog upon a task
 *     switch.
 *  5. WD Timer is stopped by MPU by disabling the timer's clock during suspend.
 *     The MPU re-enables the timer's clock upon resume.

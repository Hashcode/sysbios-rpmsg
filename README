                               SYS/BIOS RPMSG

This tree contains alternative IPC transports and Notify mechanisms.

It also contains a .bin firmware generator tool in utils, for the purpose
of generating a simple binary file that gets loaded to a core through the
Android/Linux "SysLink 3.0" firmware loader.  The format of the .bin firmware
file is proprietary.

CLONE
    o From Linux workstation, in directory where cloned tree will reside:

        /* Clone the 'sysbios-rpmsg' repository */
        git clone git://git.omapzoom.org/repo/sysbios-rpmsg.git (recommended)
                                   - or -
        git clone http://git.omapzoom.org/repo/sysbios-rpmsg.git

        /* Go into the newly cloned repository */
        cd sysbios-rpmsg

        /* Switch to the latest branch */
        git checkout -b mymaster remotes/origin/master


TOOLS
    o SYS/BIOS RPMSG build requires the following tools to be installed at the
      minimum:
        - SYS/BIOS: RTOS running on the target slave processor
        - SMP/BIOS: SMP-mode RTOS running on dual-processor target slave
                    processor subsystems (needed only for SMP-mode)
        - XDC: RTSC tools used for building and configuration of images
        - IPC: Base Inter-Processor Communication Package

BUILD (Linux Environment)
    1) Export the proper environment variables to point to your Code Generation
       Tools installation paths (mandatory step). The build targets are
       controlled based on which environment variables are defined. The
       TMS470CGTOOLPATH enables the M3 target build, while the C6000CGTOOLPATH
       enables the C6x build. If the variables are exported in between builds on
       an existing shell, do 'touch' the
       <sysbios-rpmsg>/src/config.bld for the change to become effective.
       Eg:
           export TMS470CGTOOLPATH=/data/omapts/linux/dsp-tc/cgtarm-5.0.1
                               -- and/or --
           export C6000CGTOOLPATH=/data/omapts/linux/dsp-tc/cgt6x-7.2.9

    2) Export the proper environment variable to point to your installation path
       for all the BIOS-side tools (optional, MUST set if your installation path
       is different from the default install location - /opt/ti). All the
       above tools are expected to be installed in the same path. Note that the
       path should not end with a trailing '/'.
       Eg:
           export BIOSTOOLSROOT=/data/omapts/linux/dsp-tc

    3) Export the proper environment variable to choose your own version of XDC
       tools (optional, need to set only if different from default is desired)
       Eg:
           export XDCVERSION=xdctools_3_22_01_21

    4) Export the proper environment variable(s) to choose your own versions of
       BIOS and/or IPC tools (optional, need to set only if different from
       default is desired)
       Eg:
           export BIOSVERSION=bios_6_32_01_38
                     - and/or -
           export IPCVERSION=ipc_1_23_01_26

    5) From the top-level sysbios-rpmsg directory, type in 'make' to build the
       entire tree plus sample applications

    6) Steps 1 to 4 can also be achieved alternatively by defining any of the
       variables on the make invocation line within the shell.
       Eg:
        1. make TMS470CGTOOLPATH=/data/omapts/linux/dsp-tc/cgtarm-5.0.1
             (define custom installation path for TMS470CGTOOLPATH)
        2. make BIOSTOOLSROOT=/data/omapts/linux/dsp-tc XDCVERSION=xdctools_3_22_01_21
             (define custom BIOSTOOLSROOT location and XDC version)
        3. make XDCVERSION=xdctools_3_22_01_21 BIOSVERSION=bios_6_32_01_38
             (define custom XDC and BIOS versions)

    7) Type 'make tools' or 'make info' to get your current tools location and
       versions.

    8) A default firmware binary, ducati-m3.bin is generated in the src/utils
       directory, using two of the sample baseimages in sysbios-rpmsg tree.

CLEAN (Linux Environment)
    1) Type 'make clean' to clean the generated libraries and executables

    2) The tree can be restored to a very clean state by using the following
       commands from the sysbios-rpmsg root
              rm src/.gitignore
              rm .gitignore (optional)
              git clean -df
              git reset --hard
